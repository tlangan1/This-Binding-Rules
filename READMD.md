# This Binding Rules

This repo exists to document the four "this" keyword binding rules. There is also an example of the "loosing-your-this-binding" problem. I am going to test these examples out in both a browser and in node.js.

1. Default Binding
2. Implicit Binding
3. Explicit Binding
4. Hard Binding
